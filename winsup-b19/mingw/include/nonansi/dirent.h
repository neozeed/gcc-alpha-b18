/*
 * DIRENT.H (formerly DIRLIB.H)
 *
 * by M. J. Weinstein   Released to public domain 1-Jan-89
 *
 * Because I have heard that this feature (opendir, readdir, closedir)
 * it so useful for programmers coming from UNIX or attempting to port
 * UNIX code, and because it is reasonably light weight, I have included
 * it in the Mingw32 package.
