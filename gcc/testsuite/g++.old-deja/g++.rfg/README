I hereby grant you limited permission to use this test case (and the
others I have previously posted the the gcc2 list) for the sole
purpose of finding and fixing bugs in the g++ compiler.  You may look
at it, save a copy of it online, and compile it (as often as you like)
but in all cases, my copyright notice must be maintained.  In no case
may you redistribute it outside of Cygnus Support, or make it
available for redistribution outside of Cygnus Support (e.g. via FTP
or UUCP), either alone, or as part of any larger package or test
suite.  This test case and the other test cases I have previously
posted to the gcc2 list are provided on an "as is" basis, and there is
no warrantee of any kind, either express or implied.  Neither Ron
Guilmette, nor Ron Guilmette Computing will be responsible or liable
in any way for any damages, either direct, consequential, or
incidental, arising from the use of any of the aforementioned test
cases.
