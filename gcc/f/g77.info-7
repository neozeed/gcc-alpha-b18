Table of Intrinsic Functions
----------------------------

   (Corresponds to Section 15.10 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77.)

   The GNU Fortran language adds various functions, subroutines, types,
and arguments to the set of intrinsic functions in ANSI FORTRAN 77.
The complete set of intrinsics supported by the GNU Fortran language is
described below.

   Note that a name is not treated as that of an intrinsic if it is
specified in an `EXTERNAL' statement in the same program unit; if a
command-line option is used to disable the groups to which the
intrinsic belongs; or if the intrinsic is not named in an `INTRINSIC'
statement and a command-line option is used to hide the groups to which
the intrinsic belongs.

   So, it is recommended that any reference in a program unit to an
intrinsic procedure that is not a standard FORTRAN 77 intrinsic be
accompanied by an appropriate `INTRINSIC' statement in that program
unit.  This sort of defensive programming makes it more likely that an
implementation will issue a diagnostic rather than generate incorrect
code for such a reference.

   The terminology used below is based on that of the Fortran 90
standard, so that the text may be more concise and accurate:

   * `OPTIONAL' means the argument may be omitted.

   * `A-1, A-2, ..., A-n' means more than one argument (generally named
     `A') may be specified.

   * `scalar' means the argument must not be an array (must be a
     variable or array element, or perhaps a constant if expressions
     are permitted).

   * `DIMENSION(4)' means the argument must be an array having 4
     elements.

   * `INTENT(IN)' means the argument must be an expression (such as a
     constant or a variable that is defined upon invocation of the
     intrinsic).

   * `INTENT(OUT)' means the argument must be definable by the
     invocation of the intrinsic (that is, must not be a constant nor
     an expression involving operators other than array reference and
     substring reference).

   * `INTENT(INOUT)' means the argument must be defined prior to, and
     definable by, invocation of the intrinsic (a combination of the
     requirements of `INTENT(IN)' and `INTENT(OUT)'.

   * *Note Kind Notation:: for explanation of `KIND'.

intentional--they result from a bug in the GNU `makeinfo' program...a

Abs Intrinsic
.............

     Abs(A)

Abs: `INTEGER' or `REAL' function.  The exact type depends on that of
argument A--if A is `COMPLEX', this function's type is `REAL' with the
same `KIND=' value as the type of A.  Otherwise, this function's type
is the same as that of A.

A: `INTEGER', `REAL', or `COMPLEX'; scalar; INTENT(IN).

Intrinsic groups: (standard FORTRAN 77).

Description:

   Returns the absolute value of A.

   If A is type `COMPLEX', the absolute value is computed as:

     SQRT(REALPART(A)**2, IMAGPART(A)**2)

Otherwise, it is computed by negating the A if it is negative, or
returning A.

or negative form of the absolute value of an expression.

Access: `INTEGER(KIND=1)' function.

NAME: `CHARACTER'; scalar; INTENT(IN).

MODE: `CHARACTER'; scalar; INTENT(IN).

Intrinsic groups: `unix'.

Description:

   Checks file NAME for accessibility in the mode specified by MODE and
returns 0 if the file is accessible in that mode, otherwise an error
code if the file is inaccessible or MODE is invalid.  See `access(2)'.
A null character (`CHAR(0)') marks the end of the name in
NAME--otherwise, trailing blanks in NAME are ignored.  MODE may be a
concatenation of any of the following characters:

AImag: `REAL' function.  This intrinsic is valid when argument Z is

is valid only when used as the argument to `REAL()', as explained below.

Z: `COMPLEX'; scalar; INTENT(IN).

Intrinsic groups: (standard FORTRAN 77).

Description:

   Returns the (possibly converted) imaginary part of Z.

   Use of `AIMAG()' with an argument of a type other than
`COMPLEX(KIND=1)' is restricted to the following case:

     REAL(AIMAG(Z))

This expression converts the imaginary part of Z to `REAL(KIND=1)'.

     Char(I)

Char: `CHARACTER*1' function.

I: `INTEGER'; scalar; INTENT(IN).

Intrinsic groups: (standard FORTRAN 77).

Description:

   Returns the character corresponding to the code specified by I,
using the system's native character set.

   Because the system's native character set is used, the
correspondence between character and their codes is not necessarily the
same between GNU Fortran implementations.

   Note that no intrinsic exists to convert a numerical value to a
printable character string.  For example, there is no intrinsic that,
given an `INTEGER' or `REAL' argument with the value `154', returns the
`CHARACTER' result `'154''.

   Instead, you can use internal-file I/O to do this kind of conversion.
For example:

     INTEGER VALUE
     CHARACTER*10 STRING
     VALUE = 154
     WRITE (STRING, '(I10)'), VALUE
     PRINT *, STRING
     END

   The above program, when run, prints:

             154

MODE: `CHARACTER'; scalar; INTENT(IN).

STATUS: `INTEGER(KIND=1)'; OPTIONAL; scalar; INTENT(OUT).

Description:

   Changes the access mode of file NAME according to the specification
MODE, which is given in the format of `chmod(1)'.  A null character
(`CHAR(0)') marks the end of the name in NAME--otherwise, trailing
blanks in NAME are ignored.  Currently, NAME must not contain the
single quote character.

   If the STATUS argument is supplied, it contains 0 on success or a
non-zero error code upon return.

   Note that this currently works by actually invoking `/bin/chmod' (or
the `chmod' found when the library was configured) and so may fail in
some circumstances and will, anyway, be slow.

REAL: `INTEGER' or `REAL'; scalar; INTENT(IN).

IMAG: `INTEGER' or `REAL'; scalar; INTENT(IN).

Intrinsic groups: `gnu'.

Description:

   Returns a `COMPLEX' value that has `Real' and `Imag' as its real and
imaginary parts, respectively.

   If REAL and IMAG are the same type, and that type is not `INTEGER',
no data conversion is performed, and the type of the resulting value
has the same kind value as the types of REAL and IMAG.

   If REAL and IMAG are not the same type, the usual type-promotion
rules are applied to both, converting either or both to the appropriate
`REAL' type.  The type of the resulting value has the same kind value
as the type to which both REAL and IMAG were converted, in this case.

   If REAL and IMAG are both `INTEGER', they are both converted to
`REAL(KIND=1)', and the result of the `COMPLEX()' invocation is type
`COMPLEX(KIND=1)'.

   *Note:* The way to do this in standard Fortran 90 is too hairy to
describe here, but it is important to note that `CMPLX(D1,D2)' returns
a `COMPLEX(KIND=1)' result even if `D1' and `D2' are type
`REAL(KIND=2)'.  Hence the availability of `COMPLEX()' in GNU Fortran.
