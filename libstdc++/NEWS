SUMMARY OF RECENT MAJOR CHANGES to LIBSTDC++.
(Also check ../libio/NEWS.)

*** Noteworthy changes in libstdc++ version 2.8.0:

* The STL implementation in libstdc++ is now only slightly modified from
  the HP distribution, thanks to improved template support in gcc 2.8.0.

* The string representation class is now nested in the basic_string
  template, since this is supported in the new gcc.

* As a result of these and other changes, libstc++ 2.8.0 is not binary
  compatible with previous releases of libstdc++.
